<h1>How to write to a CSV File</h1>
<p> First, let's suppose you want to write data to a CSV file with the following format in a file named 'innovators.csv':</p>
<p>
SN,Name,Contribution
1,Linus Torvalds,Linux Kernel
2,Tim Berners-Lee,World Wide Web
3,Guido van Rossum,Python Programming
</p>
<p>Then, you would write the following code:</p>
<pre>
<code>
import csv
with open('innovators.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["SN", "Name", "Contribution"])
    writer.writerow([1, "Linus Torvalds", "Linux Kernel"])
    writer.writerow([2, "Tim Berners-Lee", "World Wide Web"])
    writer.writerow([3, "Guido van Rossum", "Python Programming"])
</code>
</pre>
<p>A few things that are important to note:
<ol>
<li>
The name of the file inside open() is arbitrary and does not need to exist already, so you can change that as necessary.
</li>
<li>
If you want to know exactly where you're writing the file, you can specify a path such as '~/documents/myDocs/test.csv/' so that you can
be sure you'll find it in your documents directory.
</li>
<li>
writer.writerow() takes in any arbitrary list of information, so, presumably, if your other functions return a list, you can pass those directly to 
writer.writerow(). For example, if my_function() returns [1, 2, 3], I can call writer.writerow(my_function) which is the same as calling
writer.writerow([1, 2, 3]) which will create a new line in the CSV that reads 1,2,3.
</li>
<li>
Nothing else needs to be changed.
</li>
</ol>
