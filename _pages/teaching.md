<h1>Education *site under construction*</h1>
<body>On this page I am hoping to include a brief history of places i've taught in the past, updates about my work in education, as well as updates about my progress with KPCA- a college essay editing (and soon to be tutoring) business where I am currently an essay editor, operations manager, and product manager hoping to launch a live essay counseling service this fall. We have worked with thousands of students in the past couple of years and hope to continue building our momentum to alleviate students' stress during the college application process while also helping them become better writers all while helping them find their strengths. I also hope to write miselleneous articles about my own experiences with college admissions as well as tips and advice i've gathered over the past couple years as a college essay editor.
<br> Outside of KPCA, I have also tutored middle school and high school math and science circles at Stanford University, tutored private clients in math, and currently work as an instructor at Inspirit AI where I teach high school students the fundamental ideas and techniques used in modern Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. I hope to include beginner-level lessons to help students understand core AI concepts as early as possible.
<br> I have also recently begun assisting in reserach under Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered AI where the lab is developing robust grading and feedback mechanisms for students and teachers using Deep Reinforcement Learning (amongst other techniques) in order to tighten feedback loops to improve student outcomes. Perhaps I can publish learnings from my reserach or storiers about my experiences doing research at Stanford for younger students to learn from. </body>
