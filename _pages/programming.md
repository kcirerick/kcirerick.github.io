<h1> Programming </h1>
<body> When I first started programming two and ahlf years ago, I couldn't have predicted how central of a role it would play in my life.
	Not only has it been core driver of my professional career, but it's also been the cause of plenty of frustration, sleeplessness, and above all, excitement. I hope to populate this page with description of past projects and experiences as well as a running collection of personal and professional
projects as I build them out in real-time. </body>
