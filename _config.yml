#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hi everybody, my name is Erick and i'm a 3rd year undergraduate at Stanford University. I am
  interested in math and computer science, education, mindfulness and wellness, fitness, poker,
  and personal growth. I felt that all of my ideas just needed a place to live, so I made this.
  I hope you enjoy.
