This repository stores HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that store my first website. THIS WEBSITE IS USED SOLELY FOR PRACTICE AND JOKES AND DOES NOT REPRESENT REAL SONGS, THOUGHTS, OR OPINIONS HELD BY MYSELF OR OTHERS. Through this project, I hope to
become more familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS to become capable of developing more sophisticated and complex websites.
