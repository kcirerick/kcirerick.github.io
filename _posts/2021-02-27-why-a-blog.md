Whether or not I had realized it before now, I think that the creation of a personal blog and website has been in the making for a long time. Over the past couple of years, I have been introduced to more ideas, perspectives, and possibilities than I had been exposed to in eighteen years growing up in my hometown. During the latter half of my freshmen year at Stanford, I began to internalize that college wasn’t the end of the road for the first time. While this may seem like somewhat of a truism, I think it’s important to distinguish between facts that I know and facts that I have internalized, grappled with, and understood. After twelve years of guidance by the singular, sensible, and overarching goal of attending college as a means of beginning the rest of my life, I began to realize that the goal had inherently implied there would be a “rest of my life” to deal with. In my first two quarters at Stanford, I mostly rested on my laurels and took the time to make friends, adjust to the pace of life in the bubble, and generally get settled in, without much thought of directionality. As I slipped into rhythm, I began turning towards the future—which was my first mistake—which led me to begin asking critical questions about where I would want to be in the next 5-10 years and how I could best prepare myself to end up in those positions. Naturally, this led to further questions about my personal goals, values, interests, motivations, and yes, even my identity. 
The sudden plunge into Stanford’s diverse, vibrant, and talented student body introduced me to more ideas, perspectives, and possibilities in a matter of months than I had been exposed to in eighteen years at in my hometown which hosted truckers, commuters, farmers, and family values. I soaked in as many late-night conversations as my body could handle (at the expense of plenty of sleep), thinking that I could make sense of it all, only to find myself overwhelmed by varied and often contradictory ideas about society, personal goals, community, and even drug use.
Eventually, the stillness that Spring of 2020 forced on me gave me the stillness to clear out these ideas, identify my own first principles, and rebuild my sense of purpose around my own genuine values, interests, strengths and beliefs. In the months that followed, I continued reading, learning, and forming practices that would enable me to carry this stillness with me into the world. I went about the work of identifying my personal interests, personal values, and personal strengths. I began to prioritize personal growth, health, and longevity, human connection and empathy, quantitative reasoning and radical introspection, and, above all, curiosity. 
Since then, I have gained a reinvigorating sense of direction and purpose that has enabled me to more fully embrace my studies, more wholly give myself over to my hobbies and interests, and more thoroughly question existing structures as I continue to see how I fit into them. All the while, I have repeatedly found myself wishing I had documented the lessons I was learning as I learned them in order to reflect on my personal growth with each new season in my life. 
My hope is that this blog serves as an exercise to gain the confidence and vulnerability to share my thoughts with others while developing my writing and communication skills while serving as a paper trail for my life. In the long run, I hope that this blog can one day intersect with passion for education by enabling me to create content and build communities around authentic sharing, radical introspection, and community-oriented personal growth.
